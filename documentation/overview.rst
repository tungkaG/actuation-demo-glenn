Introduction
************

Automotive compute platforms responsible for hosting services such as Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Drive (AD) stacks require
increasingly complex and more powerful systems for these demanding workloads. To
aid with achieving the additional safety goals required in the automotive
environment, these systems benefit from the addition of a Safety Island, a
separate compute sub-system to help with functional and system monitoring.

This example shows how an AD software stack can be run in a compute environment
composed of a high-performance Primary Compute platform coupled with a
higher reliability Arm\ :sup:`®` Cortex\ :sup:`®`-R based Safety Island.

The Safety Island Actuation Demo features an Actuation Service application
running on the Safety Island that receives inputs from the Primary Compute. In
this reference implementation, the Primary Compute runs an Autoware pipeline,
and the Actuation Service takes the form of a Zephyr application showcasing the
`Pure Pursuit
<https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/pure-pursuit.html>`_
algorithm from Autoware.Auto. The two communicate via `Data Distribution Service
<https://www.dds-foundation.org/what-is-dds-3/>`_ (DDS) messages over a network
interface.

The goal of the Actuation Service is to check the input messages and to generate
actuation commands to be sent towards the actuators. A "Message Converter"
`Robot Operating System <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`_ (ROS)
package is created as part of this reference implementation, and is run on the
Primary Compute, translating the message structure to improve readability by the
Actuation Service.

The Actuation Demo git repository holds all the components necessary to run the
demo, and provides helper scripts to build and run it.

In this instance, the Primary Compute is provided by an `AVA Developer Platform
<https://www.adlinktech.com/Products/Computer_on_Modules/COM-HPC-Server-Carrier-and-Starter-Kit/AVA_Developer_Platform>`_
from ADLINK, and the Safety Island function is hosted on an NXP `S32Z Real-Time
Processor
<https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/s32-automotive-platform/s32z-and-s32e-real-time-processors:S32Z-E-REAL-TIME-PROCESSORS>`_
development board.

Use Cases
=========

- **Validation of communication**: Validating that the communication between an
  Autoware pipeline (on the Primary Compute) and the Actuation Service (on the
  Safety Island) is working. It validates that the content of ROS2 messages from
  Autoware can be received and read by a non-ROS application running on Zephyr
  on a Cortex\ :sup:`®`-R CPU. It also validates the network connection between
  the two platforms.

- **Safe execution platform**: Showing Autoware nodes running on an RTOS
  operating with the benefits of a Cortex\ :sup:`®`-R CPU.

- **Code porting example**: Preserving the ROS interface to enable Autoware
  modules running within a different OS environment.
