# Safety Island Actuation Demo

A repository providing the elements to build the different components of the Safety Island Actuation Demo.

## Documentation

Prior to building the documentation locally, the following packages need to be installed on the host:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install -U -r documentation/requirements.txt
echo 'export PATH=~/.local/bin:"$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc ; source ~/.bashrc  # only if not already in PATH
```

To build and generate the documentation in html format, run:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html -a -W documentation public
```

To render and explore the documentation, simply open public/index.html in a web browser.
